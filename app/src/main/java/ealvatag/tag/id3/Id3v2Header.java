/**
 *
 * The first part of the ID3v2 tag is the 10 byte tag header, laid out
 * as follows:
 *
 * ID3v2/file identifier      "ID3"
 * ID3v2 version              $04 00
 * ID3v2 flags                %abcd0000
 * ID3v2 size             4 * %0xxxxxxx
 *
 * The first three bytes of the tag are always "ID3", to indicate that
 * this is an ID3v2 tag, directly followed by the two version bytes. The
 * first byte of ID3v2 version is its major version, while the second
 * byte is its revision number. In this case this is ID3v2.4.0. All
 * revisions are backwards compatible while major versions are not. If
 * software with ID3v2.4.0 and below support should encounter version
 * five or higher it should simply ignore the whole tag. Version or
 * revision will never be $FF.
 *
 * The version is followed by the ID3v2 flags field, which is version specific.
 *
 * The ID3v2 tag size is stored as a 32 bit synchsafe integer (section
 * 6.2), making a total of 28 effective bits (representing up to 256MB).
 *
 * The ID3v2 tag size is the sum of the byte length of the extended
 * header, the padding and the frames after unsynchronisation. If a
 * footer is present this equals to ('total size' - 20) bytes, otherwise
 * ('total size' - 10) bytes.
